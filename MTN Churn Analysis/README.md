📊 **Project Overview**
The **MTN Pulse Churn Analysis & Retention Intelligence Dashboard** is a business intelligence solution designed to uncover key factors driving customer churn and revenue fluctuations within the MTN Pulse segment. Built using Microsoft Excel, this project provides a centralized, interactive environment to monitor retention trends, subscription behaviors, and revenue performance metrics.

The primary objective is to equip MTN decision-makers with **data-backed insights** that strengthen customer retention strategies, highlight untapped revenue streams, and guide product performance improvements. By visualizing customer churn dynamics alongside key demographic and behavioral indicators, the dashboard empowers business leaders to take **proactive, strategic actions** rather than reactive measures.

This analysis explores multiple dimensions of churn—such as customer tenure, subscription plans, device types, satisfaction levels, and data consumption—to deliver a **comprehensive view** of how different segments behave and contribute to business performance. It goes beyond surface-level observations to offer **root cause analysis**, helping MTN understand *who is leaving*, *why they’re leaving*, and *how much revenue is being lost as a result*.

In addition, the dashboard introduces **predictive angles** by identifying high-risk cohorts and underperforming offerings, creating a data-driven foundation for **targeted retention campaigns** and **customer lifecycle interventions**. Stakeholders can leverage this solution to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as churn rate, average revenue per user (ARPU), and retention by customer segment.

Ultimately, this project was built to serve as a **decision support system**—bridging the gap between raw data and executive strategy—ensuring MTN stays ahead in a competitive, high-churn telecom landscape.


❓ **Did you know?**
Reducing customer churn by just 5% can increase profits by up to 95%. This project dives deep into identifying where and why MTN Pulse customers drop off — and how to keep them engaged.

### **Key Insights**

📉👵 **Churn Is Higher Among Females, Seniors, and Middle-Aged Customers**
Female customers, along with senior and middle-aged users, show higher churn rates compared to other segments. These groups not only churn more but also represent the highest revenue contributors, making their loss more impactful. The slightly higher churn rate among females compared to males indicates the need for gender- and age-specific retention strategies to protect MTN’s most valuable customer groups.

❓ **Customer Satisfaction Correlates Poorly With Churn Reduction**
Surprisingly, even customers with "Very Good" satisfaction had a high churn rate. Similarly, churn among customers with "Poor" and "Fair" ratings remains high. This suggests that stated satisfaction may not be a reliable predictor of loyalty and that MTN must look beyond surveys—such as usage patterns, service quality metrics, and competitive offerings—to understand real customer sentiment.

📱 **Mobile SIM Users Are Most Prone to Churn**
Among all device users, those using Mobile SIM Cards have the highest churn rate, significantly more than those using 4G or 5G routers. SIM users may be more price-sensitive or have lower switching costs. This group should be prioritized for loyalty offers and bundle plans to enhance stickiness.

🔁 **Churn Is Relatively Even Across Customer Tenure**
Churn is not limited to new users. Even long-standing customers like MTN Champions and Committed Users exhibit substantial churn rates. This challenges the assumption that only new users are likely to leave and suggests a need for continuous engagement across all customer lifecycles.

💸 **High-Value Subscription Plans Drive Most Revenue**
The 1.5TB Yearly Broadband Plan and the 165GB Monthly Plan generate the most revenue. These plans should be the focal point for upselling and bundling campaigns. Lower-tier plans, although used by many, bring significantly less revenue and may also be more prone to churn.

🚀 **5G Broadband Routers Are Key Revenue Drivers**
Despite having lower churn rates, users of 5G Broadband Routers contribute the highest revenue. This underscores the importance of investing in and promoting advanced device options, which tend to attract more committed, higher-spending customers.

🧓💼 **Senior and Middle-Aged Customers Are the Top Revenue Contributors**
Seniors and middle-aged customers are responsible for over half of total revenue. Their relatively high churn rates could significantly harm MTN’s bottom line if not addressed. This makes them critical targets for premium services, loyalty programs, and retention campaigns.

📶 **SIM Card Users Consume the Most Data but Generate the Least Revenue**
Mobile SIM Card users recorded the highest data usage but contribute the lowest revenue. This reflects inefficient monetization and a potentially unsustainable user segment. Pricing, packaging, or restrictions may need to be re-evaluated for this group.

🚨 **Churned Customers Account for a Significant Revenue Loss**
Customers who churned contributed a large portion of total revenue. This is a substantial loss and reiterates the urgent need for predictive churn modeling and proactive retention measures, especially for high-value customers.

---

### **Recommendations**

📬 **Improve Customer Feedback Collection**
Since a majority of churned customers provided no reason for leaving, MTN should implement improved feedback mechanisms—such as real-time exit surveys, follow-up calls, or SMS/WhatsApp surveys—triggered immediately after a cancellation. This will help uncover root causes and inform future retention efforts.

👵💼 **Prioritize Retention of Senior and Middle-Aged Customers**
These segments have both high churn rates and the highest revenue contribution. Design age-appropriate loyalty programs, such as senior-friendly digital support, discounted renewals, or bundled offers that emphasize stability, reliability, and long-term savings.

📊 **Shift Focus from Satisfaction Surveys to Behavior-Based Insights**
As churn is high even among “Very Good” satisfaction respondents, MTN should invest in predictive analytics that combine usage patterns, complaints, service interruptions, and support tickets to better identify at-risk customers early, rather than relying solely on survey feedback.

🔁📱 **Offer Incentives for SIM Card Users to Upgrade Devices**
Since Mobile SIM users churn the most and generate the least revenue per data consumed, introduce upgrade incentives like discounts on MiFi or Router purchases, or bundle them with long-term data plans. This can help improve loyalty and profitability.

🔄 **Strengthen Retention Across All Customer Tenure Levels**
High churn across all tenure groups indicates that customer engagement should be continuous. Launch lifecycle marketing initiatives—welcome onboarding for New Joiners, periodic rewards for Connected Users, and loyalty milestones for MTN Champions.

💎 **Promote High-Revenue Subscription Plans More Aggressively**
Focus marketing and cross-sell campaigns on top-performing plans like the 1.5TB Yearly and 165GB Monthly Plans. Bundle these with added value—free devices, OTT services (e.g., Showmax, YouTube Premium), or customer care priority access—to make them more attractive and retain high-value users.

🚀📡 **Maximize Returns on 5G Router Investments**
Since 5G Broadband users contribute the most revenue and have relatively lower churn, prioritize the expansion of 5G infrastructure and offer targeted promotions (e.g., family sharing plans, business bundles). This segment should also receive premium customer service.

📅📉 **Address Revenue Seasonality Through Smarter Campaign Timing**
The drop in March revenue suggests potential seasonality or promotion lapses. Use predictive models to anticipate slow months and schedule promotions or renewals to level revenue. Consider tying high-revenue plans to longer-term contracts to improve cash flow predictability.

🚨🛑 **Use Churned Revenue Analysis for Proactive Retention**
The loss from churned customers is significant. Build churn prediction models and implement early-warning systems to flag high-value users showing signs of exit. Engage them with win-back offers, loyalty rewards, or personalized retention calls before they leave.
